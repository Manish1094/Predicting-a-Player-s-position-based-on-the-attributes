# Predicting-a-Player-s-position-based-on-the-attributes

Predicting a Playerâ€™s position based on the attributes Using the data,
create a model that accurately predicts/assigns a players position based on the individual attributes. 

# The following steps should be clearly elucidated: 
1. Data Cleaning <br />
2. Features considered for EDA and further steps. <br />
3. Exploratory Data Analysis Undertaken <br />
4. Inference from EDA <br />
5. Choice of Best Algorithm and Why <br />
6. Training Accuracy <br />
7. Predictions with test data <br />
